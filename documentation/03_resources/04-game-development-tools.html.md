## Graphics Editors

#### [Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/)

Advanced bitmap based image editor that has many capabilities similar to commercial software. It can be used as a simple paint program, an expert quality photo retouching program, an online batch processing system, a mass production image renderer, an image format converter, etc.

#### [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org/)

Advanced vector image editor with an advanced editing toolset. Inkscape has capabilities similar to commercial software such as Adobe Illustrator, CorelDraw, or Xara X. Inkscape leverages the W3C standard Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file format.
Inkscape supports many advanced SVG features (markers, clones, alpha blending, etc.) and great care is taken in designing a streamlined interface. It is very easy to edit nodes, perform complex path operations, trace bitmaps and much more.

## Sound Editors

#### [LMMS](http://lmms.sourceforge.net/)

LMMS is a free cross-platform software which allows you to produce music with your computer.

#### [SFXR](http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html)

SFXR is a sound generator, widely used for creating sound effects for LD games.

#### [BFXR](http://www.bfxr.net/)

BFXR is an improved AS3 port of SFXR with more features. It has moved in the direction of increased complexity and range of expression.

## Map Editors

### [Tiled Map Editor](http://www.mapeditor.org/)

Tiled is a general purpose tile map editor. It is meant to be used for editing maps of any tile-based game, be it an RPG, a platformer or a Breakout clone. [This demo shows how to load a tiled map](http://haxeflixel.com/demos/TiledEditor/).

### [Ogmo Editor](http://www.ogmoeditor.com/)

Ogmo Editor is a generic level editor for indie game developers who use Windows. It also happens to be free and open source. The editor is built to be reconfigurable, so you can set it up to work well for your game project. [This HaxeFlixel tutorial](http://haxeflixel.com/documentation/part-v-tiles-maps-and-collisions/) shows how to create levels with Ogmo.

## Asset Utilities

### [ShoeBox](http://renderhjs.net/shoebox/)

ShoeBox is a free Adobe Air based app for Windows and Mac OSX with game and ui related tools. It has many utilities that make asset management easier, such as [sprite packing](http://renderhjs.net/shoebox/packSprites.htm), [sprite extraction](http://renderhjs.net/shoebox/extractSprites.htm), [texture ripping](http://renderhjs.net/shoebox/textureRipper.htm), [bitmap font creation](http://renderhjs.net/shoebox/bitmapFont.htm), and more.

### [Texture Packer](https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker)

Texture Packer does one thing very well, pack several sprites into one image to reduce the number of image assets you game has to load (which helps reduce load times). It's easy to use and easy to integrate with HaxeFlixel. [This demo shows how to use a TexturePackerAtlas](http://haxeflixel.com/demos/TexturePackerAtlas/).
