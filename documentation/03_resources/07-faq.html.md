### Do I have to learn Flixel (AS3) before HaxeFlixel?
No, you have to learn HaxeFlixel to use HaxeFlixel, although previous experience with the AS3 version will help.

### Do I have to learn ActionScript before Haxe?
No, although previous experience will help.

### Do I have to learn OpenFL to use HaxeFlixel?
No, HaxeFlixel abstracts it completely.

(covering everything from installation to prototyping a platformer).

### I found a bug, where to report?
On the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel/issues).

### Is HTML5 supported?
Almost, it still is in development.

### Will next-gen consoles be supported?
Eventually, yes! Read more about it [here](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/haxeflixel/NUOpgGUKMvE/discussion).

### My sounds are lagging!?
On some platforms you need to manually cache sounds: `FlxG.sound.cache("sound");` or `FlxG.sound.cacheAll();` to do all at once.

### My player falls off-screen after walking a certain distance!
Collisions are limited to the area defined by `FlxG.worldBounds`. For example in platformers where this area needs to be larger, you need to adjust it manually.

### Can I make 3D games with HaxeFlixel?
No, the framework is limited to 2D graphics.

### How do I protect my assets from being stolen?
If you add `embed="true"` to the `<assets path="assets">` tag of the `Project.xml`, the asset files are embedded into the .exe.
