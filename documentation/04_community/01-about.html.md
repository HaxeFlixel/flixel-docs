HaxeFlixel is an open source 2D game engine written for use with the [Open Flash Library](https://github.com/openfl) and the [Haxe Toolkit](http://haxe.org), it is completely free for personal or commercial use. It enables multi-platform development for native targets on mobile and desktop as well as Flash and HTML5 on web platforms.

This project was founded by Alexander Hohlov, also known on [Beeblerox](https://github.com/Beeblerox) on GitHub, who continues to be the project lead for the [HaxeFlixel Organisation](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel) group. The project itself also has an active community with contributions from highly valued developers (by GitHub names) [GameDevSam](https://github.com/gamedevsam), [impaler](https://github.com/impaler), [Werdn](https://github.com/werdn), [ProG4mr](https://github.com/ProG4mr), [Gama11](https://github.com/gama11), [sergey-miryanov](https://github.com/sergey-miryanov) and more.

> #### Haxe and OpenFL improves the longevity and opportunities for your Flixel Games.

HaxeFlixel is largely based on the [ AS3 version of Flixel ](https://github.com/AdamAtomic/flixel) written by [ Adam “Atomic” Saltsman](http://www.adamatomic.com/). One of the major motivations for creating HaxeFlixel is overcoming the limitations of the ActionScript 3 language and the Adobe Flash and AIR runtime targets. HaxeFlixel has been able to incorporate and continues to add new language features of Haxe and incorporate exciting new runtime targets through OpenFL.

The aim of this website is to provide HaxeFlixel with a friendly and connected web presence. It has been developed by Chris Decoster with great input from the community. It provides a place for experienced developers and beginners alike, to easily share their experiences in developing and learning how to make games. We have seen the website form a central location to share resources and improve HaxeFlixel itself.

Everyone is highly encouraged to contribute to HaxeFlixel itself and the resources on this website.
