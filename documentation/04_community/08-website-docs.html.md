This website is built using [11ty static site](https://www.11ty.dev/) generator which compiles the files to a static site on a community sponsored host.
Extensions and help with improving the website and our documentation are greatly appreciated.

### Our Documentation

These documentation pages are an open-source project for the community to improve and extend. Notice the ***Edit*** button in the top right hand corner of every page. 
This will link you right to the GitHub page of the documentation where you can [fork and edit the pages](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/haxeflixel.com/fork) right in the GitHub editor.
Anyone of the HaxeFlixel team can merge pull requests and changes will be uploaded to our host.

Everything is written in the [GitHub flavoured markdown format](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown). You can see the files written in markdown from the extension `*.md`.
