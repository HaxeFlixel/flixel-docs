title: "Hello World"
```

"Hello World" is a [common example](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program) of getting started with programming, here we will show you how to add Hello World with HaxeFlixel's `FlxText`. You can compile this test for any supported target platform.

Make sure you have installed Flixel, as well as set up the `lime` and `flixel` commands [as explained previously](/documentation/install-haxeflixel/).

### Create a new HaxeFlixel Project

HaxeFlixel requires a basic structure of files for any project that can be created automatically for you. First open a command prompt and switch to the directory where you'd like to have the project using `cd`, for example:

```bash
cd C:\Users\<User>\Projects
```

Then run the `template` command (`tpl` for short):

``` bash
flixel tpl -n "HelloWorld"
```

You will now see a new folder named "HelloWorld" with all the files for your project being created automatically.

### Add the "Hello World" `FlxText`

Adding the text is as simple as opening the `PlayState.hx` file in the newly created `source` folder. The file should look like this:

``` haxe
package;

import flixel.FlxState;

class PlayState extends FlxState
{
	override public function create()
	{
		super.create();
	}

	override public function update(elapsed:Float)
	{
		super.update(elapsed);
	}
}
```

All you need to do is add the following three lines to the `create()` function (and save the file):

``` haxe
override public function create()
{
	super.create();
		
	var text = new flixel.text.FlxText(0, 0, 0, "Hello World", 64);
	text.screenCenter();
	add(text);
}
```

This will create a new `FlxText` instance with font size `64`, center it on the screen and `add()` it so it is displayed.

### Test the Project

Return to your command line window - now we can compile the project. First switch to the directory containing the `Project.xml` file:

```bash
cd HelloWorld
```

You can then compile to HTML5, Neko and Flash out of the box with these commands:

``` bash
lime test html5
lime test neko
lime test flash
```

Other targets require further setup. For more details, check the "Advanced Setup" section of the [Lime documentation](https://lime.openfl.org/docs/home/).
