If you have successfully compiled a Hello World sample, the best place we recommend is to jump to our large collection of demos to learn by example, try improving a game and pulling one apart to see how it works:

*	[Demos](http://haxeflixel.com/demos)
*   [Source for the demos](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel-demos)

If you are totally new to Flixel, please review our Handbook here:

*   [Handbook](http://haxeflixel.com/documentation/haxeflixel-handbook/)

We also strongly recommend reading about the systems behind HaxeFlixel by reading our community documentation:

*   [Community](http://haxeflixel.com/documentation/community/)

For AS3 developers, you can get a quickstart on Haxe from this:

*   [AS3 and Haxe Comparison](http://haxeflixel.com/documentation/as3-and-haxe-comparison/)
*   [â€‹Haxe API](http://api.haxe.org/)

We also invite you to talk with our community in the forums and IRC! :)

*   [Forum](http://forum.haxeflixel.com)
*   [#haxeflixel on freenode IRC](irc://chat.freenode.net/#haxeflixel)

Furthermore, this documentation and website is the front of HaxeFlixel information and we welcome additions from users like you. :)
