Welcome to HaxeFlixel, here we will show you how to setup your system to start making games with Mac, Linux or Windows.

Getting started requires three steps:

1. [Install OpenFL and Haxe](http://www.openfl.org/download/)
2. [Install HaxeFlixel](/documentation/install-haxeflixel)
3. [HaxeFlixel Hello World](/documentation/hello-world-command-line)

For FlashDevelop users: [Getting started easily with FlashDevelop](/documentation/FlashDevelop/)

----

Time to complete this installation is close to 20 minutes (depending on the speed of your Internet connection for downloading the components).

If you require some help:
 
- Ask a question in the [community forums](/forum);
- Join the IRC channel [#haxeflixel](irc://chat.freenode.net/#haxeflixel) on freenode.
