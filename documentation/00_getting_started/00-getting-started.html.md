Welcome to HaxeFlixel, here we will show you how to setup your system to start making games with Mac, Linux or Windows.

Getting started requires three steps:

1. [Install OpenFL and Haxe](http://www.openfl.org/documentation/setup/)
2. [Install HaxeFlixel](/documentation/install-haxeflixel)
4. [HaxeFlixel Hello World](/documentation/hello-world-command-line)

----

Time to complete this installation is close to 20 minutes. 
(depending on the speed of your Internet connection for downloading the components)
