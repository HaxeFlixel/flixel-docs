title: "Install Haxe"
```

The Haxe Toolkit is available for [Windows](http://haxe.org/file/haxe-3.1.1-win.exe), [Linux](http://www.openfl.org/haxe-3.1.1-linux-installer.tar.gz) and [Mac](http://haxe.org/file/haxe-3.1.1-osx-installer.pkg).

*Note:* The latest version of the Haxe Toolkit is not compatible with the latest version of OpenFL. To avoid this issue until the bug is fixed, download the previous version of Haxe here: http://haxe.org/download?version=20019

## Test Haxe installation

For a simple test to see if Haxe is now working on your system, open a new command prompt / terminal window and type ```haxe```. You should see something like this:

```bash
Haxe Compiler 3.1.1 - (C)2005-2013 Haxe Foundation
 Usage : haxe.exe -main <class> [-swf|-js|-neko|-php|-cpp|-as3] <output> [options]
 [...]
```

## haxelib

Haxe comes with its own library manager called [haxelib](http://lib.haxe.org/), which greatly simplifies installing and updating libraries.

Please make sure you are running the latest version with the selfupdate command:

``` bash
haxelib selfupdate

# if you're using haxe  < 3.1
haxe upgrade.hxml
#if you're using haxe >= 3.1
haxe update.hxml
```

You can see more of how to use haxelib [here](http://haxe.org/doc/haxelib/using_haxelib) and browse Haxe community libraries on the [official site](http://lib.haxe.org/).

## Upgrading Haxe

If you're upgrading from a Haxe 2.x install, you need to uninstall Haxe as well as remove the haxelib folders, in Windows you will find them in ```(C:\MotionTwin\...)```.
