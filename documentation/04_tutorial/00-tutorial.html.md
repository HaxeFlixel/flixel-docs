Welcome to HaxeFlixel! You are on your way to using the best Game Development Framework (at least, in my opinion)!

In this series of tutorials, I will walk you through making a complete game in HaxeFlixel from start to finish, and then some. Iâ€™ve broken down each step into smaller chunks to help you get through even the most complicated and daunting steps.

I will gear these tutorials towards building on Flash, Windows, and Android (since those are the platforms I have access to). We will work primarily with Flash most of the time.

If you have any questions, or get stuck during this tutorial, you can post on our [community forums](http://haxeflixel.com/forum/), or in the #haxeflixel irc channel on freenode.

This tutorial was written using HaxeFlixel version 3.3.0.

So lets go ahead and get started!
