Welcome to HaxeFlixel! You are on your way to using the best game engine (at least, in my opinion)!
In this series of tutorials, I will walk you through making a complete game in HaxeFlixel from start to finish, and
then some. I’ve broken down each step into smaller chunks to help you get through even the most complicated and
daunting steps.

I will gear these tutorials towards building on Flash, Windows, and Android (since those are the platforms I have access
to). We will work primarily with Flash most of the time.

We are going to be building a small dungeon crawler. You can see the finished product here:

If you have any questions, or get stuck during this tutorial, you can post on our
[community forums](http://haxeflixel.com/forum/), or in the #haxeflixel IRC channel on freenode.

This tutorial was originally written using HaxeFlixel version 3.3.0, but updated for 4.0.0.

So let's go ahead and get started!
