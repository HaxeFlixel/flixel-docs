Welcome to HaxeFlixel! You are on your way to using the best Game Development Framework (at least, in my opinion)!

In this series of tutorials, I will walk you through making a complete game in HaxeFlixel from start to finish, and then some. I’ve broken down each step into smaller chunks to help you get through even the most complicated and daunting steps.

I will gear these tutorials towards building on Flash, Windows, and Android (since those are the platforms I have access to). We will work primarily with Flash most of the time.

If you have any questions, or get stuck during this tutorial, you can post on our [community forums](http://haxeflixel.com/forum/), or in the #haxeflixel irc channel on freenode.

This tutorial was written using HaxeFlixel version 3.3.0.

So lets go ahead and get started!
