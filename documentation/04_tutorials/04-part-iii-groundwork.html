title: "Part III: Groundwork"
```

<p>Now it's time to think about what we actually want our game to be, and how we're going to pull it off. Luckily, I've done all the hard work for you.</p>

<p>The game I'm going to help you build will be a very simple top-down 'dungeon crawl' game, where the player controls a single character, moves around a map and fights enemies, and collects gold.</p>

<p>So, what does that all actually translate to in HaxeFlixel?</p>

<ul>
	<li>First, we're going to need to setup our 'world' - this just means we'll need to have a FlxState where all the action happens, and figure out what we're going to put in the world.</li>
	<li>For the dungeon itself, it will simply be a FlxTilemap - and we'll draw our maps in another tool.</li>
	<li>We will need a FlxSprite to represent the player on the screen. This will be the sprite that player will be able to control.</li>
	<li>Enemies will be FlxSprites as well, and we'll have a 'fancy' way to have different types of enemies.</li>
	<li>We'll also need a HUD/Interface for the player to do stuff with and see what's going on. These will be a combination of FlxGroups, FlxSprites, FlxTexts, FlxButtons, and some other things.</li>
</ul>

<p>We'll tackle each of these things one-by-one.</p>

<p>First up, let's get our player from the MenuState to our PlayState. Eventually, we'll want a fancy MenuState with a button for Options, but, for right now, we'll just have a button that says "Play" and goes to our PlayState.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<p>Go ahead and delete the line we added for our "Hello World" test.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Next, go up to the top of the class - right under where it says:</p>
		<p><pre><code class="haxe">class MenuState extends FlxState
{</code></pre></p>
		<p>We're going define a new variable. This is where you would define all the variables that you intend to use throughout a given class. We need to define a new FlxButton variable to use as our 'play' button. So, type:</p>
		<p><pre><code class="haxe">private var _btnPlay:FlxButton;</code></pre></p>
		<p>Note: If you're using FlashDevelop, it should automatically create an import for FlxButton (`import flixel.ui.FlxButton;`) at the top of the class. This should be mostly automatic whenever you use class, but if it doesn't add it for some reason, you can enter it manually, or, highlight FlxButton in the editor and hit <code>ctrl+shift+1</code> to add it.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Now, go down to our create() function, and, right before <code>super.create();</code>, type:</p>
		<p><pre><code class="haxe">_btnPlay = new FlxButton(0, 0, "Play", clickPlay);
add(_btnPlay);</code></pre></p>
		<p>This creates a FlxButton object and assigns it to the _btnPlay variable. We're telling it to make the button at position 0,0 (the top left corner of the screen), to make it say "Play" on it, and to call the function "clickPlay" when a user clicks the button (clickPlay doesn't exist yet, but we're going to make it).</p>
		<p>Then we add the object to our State so that it can be shown and interacted with.</p>
		<p>Don't worry about the position of the button right now, we're going to move it in a second.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Now we need to define our clickPlay function. Somewhere in the class, outside of any existing functions, type:</p>
		<p><pre><code class="haxe">private function clickPlay():Void
{
	FlxG.switchState(new PlayState());
}</code></pre></p>
		<p>This function calls FlxG.switchState, which switches the state from whatever the current state is (MenuState) to a new instance of PlayState.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Technically, at this point, the functionality would work - you could run your game and it would do what we want it to do, but we're missing a few things.</p>
		<p>First, we want the button to be in a nicer place. Sure, we could set the x,y coordinates when we create it, but there's a simpler way to do it.</p>
		<p>Go up to the import section of the class, and, in a new line, type:</p>
		<p><pre><code class="haxe">using flixel.util.FlxSpriteUtil;</code></pre></p>
		<p>This is going to allow us to use some of FlxSpriteUtil's (one of many useful utility classes in HaxeFlixel) functions on our own objects in this class. This is thanks to a Haxe feature called Static Extension, and can be used for some powerful results.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Back in the create function, add a new line somewhere after we create our FlxButton, and before <code>super.create();</code> (I like to add it before the button is added, but that's just my preference).</p>
		<p>Type:</p>
		<p><pre><code class="haxe">_btnPlay.screenCenter();</code></pre></p>
		<p>screenCenter is a function in FlxSpriteUtil which takes an object and centers it on the screen either horizontally, vertically or (by default) both. By calling it on our button, the button will be placed in the center of the screen.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Finally, we need to make sure we clean things up a little. Go back up the imports and add:</p>
		<p><pre><code class="haxe">import flixel.util.FlxDestroyUtil;</code></pre></p>
		<p>This is another utility class. This one gives us safe ways to remove and cleanup objects that we create.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Next, go down to the destroy function, and in a new line right after super.destroy(); add:</p>
		<p><pre><code class="haxe">_btnPlay = FlxDestroyUtil.destroy(_btnPlay);</code></pre></p>
		<p>This is going to remove our button object from memory, as well as set the variable to null, which allows it to be completely cleared when garbage collection happens.</p>
		<p>It's good practice to make sure that any class-wide objects you create are properly destroyed, otherwise  you can start to see performance issues.</p>
		<p>Note: I know we could have skipped this whole part if we had NOT defined _btnPlay as a class-wide variable, and instead just created it in the create function, but we'll be coming back to this button later on, and it's good practice to get into the habit of destroying your objects.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>If you test your game out now, it should go straight to a black screen with our 'Play' button in the middle, and clicking the button will take you to another black screen. If that's what you get, it works! (Trust me!) So far, so good!</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Next, let's make a simple Player Sprite that you can move around on the screen.</p>

<p>First, we need to make a new Player class. You can think of classes as sort of a functional template. You can use them as-is in a project, but you also have the ability to Extend them into new versions. You can kind of think of it as using tracing paper - when you extend a class, you put a new sheet of tracing paper on top - you can still see and use all the stuff in the original class (unless you draw over it), and you can add your own stuff.</p>

<p>We're going to be extending the FlxSprite class to create our Player class.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<p>In the Project list on the right side of your screen, right-click on your `source' folder, and choose `Add', and then `New Class.'.</p>
		<p><img src="/images/tutorial/0004.png" /></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>In the New Haxe Class Dialog that pops up, enter "Player" for "Name", and next to "Base Class", click "Browse." and search for "flixel.FlxSprite" and choose it.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Once your screen looks like this, hit "OK":</p>
		<p><img src="/images/tutorial/0005.png" /></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>You should now see a very basic class which extends FlxSprite:</p>
		<p><pre><code class="haxe">package ;

import flixel.FlxSprite;

class Player extends FlxSprite
{
	public function new(X:Float=0, Y:Float=0, ?SimpleGraphic:Dynamic) 
	{
		super(X, Y, ?SimpleGraphic);	
	}
}</code></pre></p>
		<p>We'll need to fix this up a bit to make it usable.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>First, lets take out the SimpleGraphic parameter in the constructor. For our Player sprite, we don't need to pass it the graphic.</p>
		<p>So</p>
		<p><pre><code class="haxe">public function new(X:Float=0, Y:Float=0, ?SimpleGraphic:Dynamic)</code></pre></p>
		<p>Becomes</p>
		<p><pre><code class="haxe">public function new(X:Float=0, Y:Float=0)</code></pre></p>
		<p>and</p>
		<p><pre><code class="haxe">super(X, Y, ?SimpleGraphic);</code></pre></p>
		<p>becomes</p>
		<p><pre><code class="haxe">super(X, Y);</code></pre></p>
		<p>With classes, we use the 'super' command to refer to the parent class. So, within out 'new' constructor, by calling super(X, Y) we are basically saying to go up the chain to our parent class, in this case FlxSprite, and call its constructor, passing it the X and Y parameters that were passed to us.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Next, we'll want to create a placeholder image to show us where our Sprite is, so under  super(X, Y);, add:</p>
		<p><pre><code class="haxe">makeGraphic(16, 16, FlxColor.BLUE);</code></pre></p>
		<p>(Make sure that an import is created for FlxColor, and if it isn't, add it.)</p>
		<p>All we're doing here is saying that we want to make this sprite's graphic be a 16x16 pixel blue square.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>For right now, we just want to get the Player class initialized, make sure that it works, and try adding it to our PlayState. It's not going to move or do anything yet, that will come in a minute. So save the changes to our Player class, and go back to the PlayState.</p>
		<p>We need to define our Player variable, so underneath the class line, add:</p>
		<p><pre><code class="haxe">private var _player:Player;</code></pre></p>
		<p>And in the create() function, before super.create(); add:</p>
		<p><pre><code class="haxe">_player = new Player(20, 20);
add(_player);</code></pre></p>
		<p>This simply assigns a new instance of our Player sprite to our _player variable, telling it to be placed at 20, 20 on the screen, and adds it to our PlayState.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>If you run your project right now, you should see our blue player on the screen!</p>
		<p><img src="/images/tutorial/0006.png" /></p>
		<p>Now let's get it to move around!</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>So, how do we actually want our Player to move around on the screen? Well, I think it should be able to move using the Arrow keys and/or the WASD keys, in 8 directions: up, down, left, right, and diagonally. The player should move at a relatively fixed speed, but have a slight deceleration before stopping to give it just a little bit of 'feeling'.</p>

<p>First, let's define our player's movement speed and deceleration amounts:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<p>In your Player class, above your new constructor, add:</p>
		<p><pre><code class="haxe">public var speed:Float = 200;</code></pre></p>
		<p>Then, in the constructor, after you call makeGraphic, we need to add some drag:</p>
		<p><pre><code class="haxe">drag.x = drag.y = 1600;</code></pre></p>
		<p>Drag, in HaxeFlixel, is sort of a way to slow down an object when it's not being moved. This will prevent our Player sprite from just running forever in the same direction when the user stops pressing any movement keys.</p>
		<p>This is sort of arbitrary based on what 'feels' right - we can come back and tweak the numbers later on.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>While there are plenty of ways to handle player movement, it can be simpler to add it to the Player class. We'll want to add a new function that will watch for player input and respond to it, so, make a new function:</p>
		<p><pre><code class="haxe">private function updateMovement():Void
{
}</code></pre></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>First, inside that new function, we want to define some helper variables so we can easily tell which keys were pressed later on in the function:</p>
		<p><pre><code class="haxe">var _up:Bool = false;
var _down:Bool = false;
var _left:Bool = false;
var _right:Bool = false;</code></pre></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Next, we want to actually find out which of these directions the player wants to move in. We'll do that by checking if certain keys are being pressed:</p>
		<p><pre><code class="haxe">_up = FlxG.keys.anyPressed(["UP", "W"]);
_down = FlxG.keys.anyPressed(["DOWN", "S"]);
_left = FlxG.keys.anyPressed(["LEFT", "A"]);
_right = FlxG.keys.anyPressed(["RIGHT", "D"]);</code></pre></p>
		<p>The anyPressed function allows us to ask if any keys out of a list of keys are currently being pressed. You send it an array of Keys (their names) and it will return 'true' if any of them are pressed. There are a couple of similar functions to check for other key states we might use later on.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Next, we want to cancel out opposing directions - if the player is pressing Up and Down at the same time, we're not going to move anywhere:</p>
		<p><pre><code class="haxe">if (_up && _down)
     _up = _down = false;
if (_left && _right)
     _left = _right = false;</code></pre></p>
     </li>
     <li>
     	<p>Next, we'll make sure the player is actually moving:</p>
     	<p><pre><code class="haxe">if ( _up || _down || _left || _right)
{</code></pre></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Next, we need to determine which direction to move the player, and by how much. There's a common mistake that I see from people making games which allow for diagonal movement, and that is that if they do something like this:</p>
		<p><pre><code class="haxe">velocity.x = Speed;
velocity.y = Speed;</code></pre></p>
		<p>While this will, technically, move something diagonally down and right, it will actually move much FASTER than it really should be moving. This is because of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem">the way triangles work</a>. So, for our Player to move, we're not just going to set its velocity = Speed - that would be too easy! Instead, we're going to calculate exactly what its velocity should be with Angles!</p>
		<p>The first part of this is to figure out what angle we want to have the player move based on the keys that are being pressed. In HaxeFlixel, angle 0 is to the right, and -90 (or 270) is up.</p>
		<p><pre><code class="haxe">var mA:Float = 0;
if (_up)
{
	mA = -90;
	if (_left)
		mA -= 45;
	else if (_right)
		mA += 45;
}
else if (_down)
{
	mA = 90;
	if (_left)
		mA += 45;
	else if (_right)
		mA -= 45;
}
else if (_left)
	mA = 180;
else if (_right)
	mA = 0;</code></pre></p>
		<p>All this will do is create a temporary variable to hold our angle, and then, based on which direction(s) the player is pressing, set that angle to the direction we plan on moving the player.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Now, we know which angle the player should be moving in, we need to figure out how much velocity it needs to move that way. We're going to do this by creating a point, which will be how much velocity the player would have if our angle was 0, then rotate it based on our actual angle, and finally make our player's velocity equal to the resulting, rotated point:</p>
		<p><pre><code class="haxe">FlxAngle.rotatePoint(speed, 0, 0, 0, mA, velocity);</code></pre></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Next, close the bracket from your 'if' statement from earlier:</p>
		<p><pre><code class="haxe">}</code></pre></p>
		<p>...and that's the end of our updateMovement function!</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>The only thing left to do is to add a call to this function in our update() function, and we're good to go!</p>
		<p>Just before the `super.update();`, add:</p>
		<p><pre><code class="haxe">updateMovement();</code></pre></p>
		<p>The update function, as you should remember, is called each 'frame' of the game. So, each time our PlayState gets its update called, when it calls update on all of its members, it will trigger the player's update which will check our updateMovement logic, adjust the player's velocity accordingly, and then call its super.update(), which will take the velocity that we've just changed into account and figures out where the player sprite should move.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Whew! It sounds a lot more complicated than it really is - if you try out the game right now, you'll see that you can run around the screen by pressing any combination of arrow keys and WASD!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/SeiferTim/HaxeFlixel-Tutorial/tree/Part-III">Here's the source</a> for the two classes we've worked on so far, so you can make sure you're on the right page. Next, we'll work on making the player sprite actually look like something!</p>
