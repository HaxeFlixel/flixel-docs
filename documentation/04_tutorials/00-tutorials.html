<p>Welcome to HaxeFlixel! You are on your way to using the best Game Development Framework (at least, in my opinion)!</p>

<p>In this series of tutorials, I will walk you through making a complete game in HaxeFlixel from start to finish, and then some. Iâ€™ve broken down each step into smaller chunks to help you get through even the most complicated and daunting steps.</p>

<p>I will gear these tutorials towards building on Flash, Windows, and Android (since those are the platforms I have access to). We will work primarily with Flash most of the time.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, or get stuck during this tutorial, you can post on our <a href="http://haxeflixel.com/forum/">community forums</a>, or in the #haxeflixel IRC channel on freenode.</p>

<p>This tutorial was written using HaxeFlixel version 3.3.0.</p>

<p>So let's go ahead and get started!</p>
