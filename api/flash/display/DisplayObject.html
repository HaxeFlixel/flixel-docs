 *
 * <p>The Sprite class also includes a <code>graphics</code>property, and it
 * includes other features not available to the Shape class. For example, a
 * Sprite object is a display object container, whereas a Shape object is not

 * consume less memory than Sprite objects that contain the same graphics.
 * However, a Sprite object supports user input events, while a Shape object
 * does not.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="doc"><p>The DisplayObject class is the base class for all objects that can be
 * placed on the display list. The display list manages all objects displayed
 * in flash. Use the DisplayObjectContainer class to arrange the
 * display objects in the display list. DisplayObjectContainer objects can
 * have child display objects, while other display objects, such as Shape and
 * TextField objects, are "leaf" nodes that have only parents and siblings, no
 * children.
 <em>
 * <p>The DisplayObject class supports basic functionality like the <i>x</i>
 * and <i>y</i> position of an object, as well as more advanced properties of
 * the object such as its transformation matrix. </p>
 </em>
 * <p>DisplayObject is an abstract base class; therefore, you cannot call
 * DisplayObject directly. Invoking <code>new DisplayObject()</code> throws an
 * <code>ArgumentError</code> exception. </p>
 <em>
 * <p>All display objects inherit from the DisplayObject class.</p>
 </em>
 * <p>The DisplayObject class itself does not include any APIs for rendering
 * content onscreen. For that reason, if you want create a custom subclass of
 * the DisplayObject class, you will want to extend one of its subclasses that
 * do have APIs for rendering content onscreen, such as the Shape, Sprite,
 * Bitmap, SimpleButton, TextField, or MovieClip class.</p>
 <em>
 * <p>The DisplayObject class contains several broadcast events. Normally, the
 * target of any particular event is a specific DisplayObject instance. For
 * example, the target of an <code>added</code> event is the specific
 * DisplayObject instance that was added to the display list. Having a single
 * target restricts the placement of event listeners to that target and in
 * some cases the target's ancestors on the display list. With broadcast
 * events, however, the target is not a specific DisplayObject instance, but
 * rather all DisplayObject instances, including those that are not on the
 * display list. This means that you can add a listener to any DisplayObject
 * instance to listen for broadcast events. In addition to the broadcast
 * events listed in the DisplayObject class's Events table, the DisplayObject
 * class also inherits two broadcast events from the EventDispatcher class:
 * <code>activate</code> and <code>deactivate</code>.</p>

 * <p>Some properties previously used in the ActionScript 1.0 and 2.0
 * MovieClip, TextField, and Button classes(such as <code><em>alpha</code>,
 * <code></em>height</code>, <code><em>name</code>, <code></em>width</code>,
 * <code><em>x</code>, <code></em>y</code>, and others) have equivalents in the

 </em>

 * classes that define specific filters you can use.
 <em>
 * <p>Filters can be applied in Flash Professional at design time, or at run
 * time by using ActionScript code. To apply a filter by using ActionScript,
 * you must make a temporary copy of the entire <code>filters</code> array,
 * modify the temporary array, then assign the value of the temporary array
 * back to the <code>filters</code> array. You cannot directly add a new
 * filter object to the <code>filters</code> array.</p>
 </em>
 * <p>To add a filter by using ActionScript, perform the following steps
 * (assume that the target display object is named
 * <code>myDisplayObject</code>):</p>
 <em>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Create a new filter object by using the constructor method of your
 * chosen filter class.</li>
 *   <li>Assign the value of the <code>myDisplayObject.filters</code> array
 * to a temporary array, such as one named <code>myFilters</code>.</li>
 *   <li>Add the new filter object to the <code>myFilters</code> temporary
 * array.</li>
 *   <li>Assign the value of the temporary array to the
 * <code>myDisplayObject.filters</code> array.</li>
 * </ol>
 </em>
 * <p>If the <code>filters</code> array is undefined, you do not need to use
 * a temporary array. Instead, you can directly assign an array literal that
 * contains one or more filter objects that you create. The first example in
 * the Examples section adds a drop shadow filter by using code that handles
 * both defined and undefined <code>filters</code> arrays.</p>
 <em>
 * <p>To modify an existing filter object, you must use the technique of
 * modifying a copy of the <code>filters</code> array:</p>
 </em>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Assign the value of the <code>filters</code> array to a temporary
 * array, such as one named <code>myFilters</code>.</li>
 *   <li>Modify the property by using the temporary array,
 * <code>myFilters</code>. For example, to set the quality property of the
 * first filter in the array, you could use the following code:
 * <code>myFilters[0].quality = 1;</code></li>
 *   <li>Assign the value of the temporary array to the <code>filters</code>
 * array.</li>
 * </ol>
 <em>
 * <p>At load time, if a display object has an associated filter, it is
 * marked to cache itself as a transparent bitmap. From this point forward,
 * as long as the display object has a valid filter list, the player caches
 * the display object as a bitmap. This source bitmap is used as a source
 * image for the filter effects. Each display object usually has two bitmaps:
 * one with the original unfiltered source display object and another for the
 * final image after filtering. The final image is used when rendering. As
 * long as the display object does not change, the final image does not need
 * updating.</p>
