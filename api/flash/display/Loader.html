 * files. Use the <code>load()</code> method to initiate loading. The loaded
 * display object is added as a child of the Loader object.
 <em>
 * <p>Use the URLLoader class to load text or binary data.</p>
 </em>
 * <p>The Loader class overrides the following methods that it inherits,
 * because a Loader object can only have one child display object - the
 * display object that it loads. Calling the following methods throws an
 * exception: <code>addChild()</code>, <code>addChildAt()</code>,
 * <code>removeChild()</code>, <code>removeChildAt()</code>, and
 * <code>setChildIndex()</code>. To remove a loaded display object, you must
 * remove the <i>Loader</i> object from its parent DisplayObjectContainer
 * child array. </p>
 <em>
 * <p><b>Note:</b> The ActionScript 2.0 MovieClipLoader and LoadVars classes
 * are not used in ActionScript 3.0. The Loader and URLLoader classes replace
 * them.</p>
 </em>
 * <p>When you use the Loader class, consider the Flash Player and Adobe AIR
 * security model: </p>
 <em>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>You can load content from any accessible source. </li>
 *   <li>Loading is not allowed if the calling SWF file is in a network
 * sandbox and the file to be loaded is local. </li>
 *   <li>If the loaded content is a SWF file written with ActionScript 3.0, it
 * cannot be cross-scripted by a SWF file in another security sandbox unless
 * that cross-scripting arrangement was approved through a call to the
 * <code>System.allowDomain()</code> or the
 * <code>System.allowInsecureDomain()</code> method in the loaded content
 * file.</li>
 *   <li>If the loaded content is an AVM1 SWF file(written using ActionScript
 * 1.0 or 2.0), it cannot be cross-scripted by an AVM2 SWF file(written using
 * ActionScript 3.0). However, you can communicate between the two SWF files
 * by using the LocalConnection class.</li>
 *   <li>If the loaded content is an image, its data cannot be accessed by a
 * SWF file outside of the security sandbox, unless the domain of that SWF
 * file was included in a URL policy file at the origin domain of the
 * image.</li>
 *   <li>Movie clips in the local-with-file-system sandbox cannot script movie
 * clips in the local-with-networking sandbox, and the reverse is also
 * prevented. </li>
 *   <li>You cannot connect to commonly reserved ports. For a complete list of
 * blocked ports, see "Restricting Networking APIs" in the <i>ActionScript 3.0
 * Developer's Guide</i>. </li>
 * </ul>
 </em>
 * <p>However, in AIR, content in the <code>application</code> security
 * sandbox(content installed with the AIR application) are not restricted by
 * these security limitations.</p>

 * <p>When loading a SWF file from an untrusted source(such as a domain other
 * than that of the Loader object's root SWF file), you may want to define a
 * mask for the Loader object, to prevent the loaded content(which is a child
 * of the Loader object) from drawing to portions of the Stage outside of that
 * mask, as shown in the following code:</p></p></div><h2>Instance Fields</h2><div class="platform platform-flash"><a name="content"></a><h3><p><code><span class="keyword">var</span> <a href="#content"><span class="identifier">content</span></a>:<a class="type" href="../../flash/display/DisplayObject.html">DisplayObject</a></code></p></h3><div class="doc"><p>Contains the root display object of the SWF file or image(JPG, PNG, or

 <em>
 * <p>Events related to the load are dispatched by the LoaderInfo object
 * referenced by the <code>contentLoaderInfo</code> property of the Loader

 * LoaderInfo object, even before the content is loaded, so that you can add
 * event listeners to the object prior to the load.</p>
 </em>
 * <p>To detect uncaught errors that happen in a loaded SWF, use the

 * with no registered listeners.
 <em>
 * <p>Note that a Loader object's <code>uncaughtErrorEvents</code> property
 * dispatches events that bubble through it, not events that it dispatches

 * phases. To detect an uncaught error in the current SWF(the SWF in which
 * the Loader object is defined) use the
 * <code>LoaderInfo.uncaughtErrorEvents</code> property instead.</p>
 </em>
 * <p>If the content loaded by the Loader object is an AVM1(ActionScript 2)
 * SWF file, uncaught errors in the AVM1 SWF file do not result in an

 * method of a DisplayObjectContainer instance). The asset appears on the
 * Stage as it loads.
 <em>
 * <p>You can also use a Loader instance "offlist," that is without adding it
 * to a display object container on the display list. In this mode, the
 * Loader instance might be used to load a SWF file that contains additional
 * modules of an application. </p>
 </em>
 * <p>To detect when the SWF file is finished loading, you can use the events
 * of the LoaderInfo object associated with the
 * <code>contentLoaderInfo</code> property of the Loader object. At that
 * point, the code in the module SWF file can be executed to initialize and
 * start the module. In the offlist mode, a Loader instance might also be
 * used to load a SWF file that contains components or media assets. Again,
 * you can use the LoaderInfo object event notifications to detect when the
 * components are finished loading. At that point, the application can start
 * using the components and media assets in the library of the SWF file by
 * instantiating the ActionScript 3.0 classes that represent those components
 * and assets.</p>
 <em>
 * <p>To determine the status of a Loader object, monitor the following

 </em>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The <code>open</code> event is dispatched when loading begins.</li>
 *   <li>The <code>ioError</code> or <code>securityError</code> event is
 * dispatched if the file cannot be loaded or if an error occured during the
 * load process. </li>
 *   <li>The <code>progress</code> event fires continuously while the file is
 * being loaded.</li>
 *   <li>The <code>complete</code> event is dispatched when a file completes
 * downloading, but before the loaded movie clip's methods and properties are
 * available. </li>
 *   <li>The <code>init</code> event is dispatched after the properties and
 * methods of the loaded SWF file are accessible, so you can begin
 * manipulating the loaded SWF file. This event is dispatched before the
 * <code>complete</code> handler. In streaming SWF files, the
 * <code>init</code> event can occur significantly earlier than the

 <em>
 * <p><b>Note</b>: In AIR 1.5 and Flash Player 10, the maximum size for a

 * and 2,880 pixels in width.</p>
 </em>
 * <p>A SWF file or image loaded into a Loader object inherits the position,
 * rotation, and scale properties of the parent display objects of the Loader
 * object. </p>
 <em>
 * <p>Use the <code>unload()</code> method to remove movies or images loaded
 * with this method, or to cancel a load operation that is in progress.</p>
 </em>
 * <p>You can prevent a SWF file from using this method by setting the
 * <code>allowNetworking</code> parameter of the the <code>object</code> and
 * <code>embed</code> tags in the HTML page that contains the SWF
 * content.</p>
 <em>
 * <p>When you use this method, consider the Flash Player security model,
 * which is described in the Loader class description. </p>
 </em>
 * <p> In Flash Player 10 and later, if you use a multipart Content-Type(for
 * example "multipart/form-data") that contains an upload(indicated by a
 * "filename" parameter in a "content-disposition" header within the POST
 * body), the POST operation is subject to the security rules applied to
 * uploads:</p>
 <em>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The POST operation must be performed in response to a user-initiated
 * action, such as a mouse click or key press.</li>
 *   <li>If the POST operation is cross-domain(the POST target is not on the
 * same server as the SWF file that is sending the POST request), the target
 * server must provide a URL policy file that permits cross-domain
 * access.</li>
 * </ul>
 </em>
 * <p>Also, for any multipart Content-Type, the syntax must be valid
 * (according to the RFC2046 standard). If the syntax appears to be invalid,
 * the POST operation is subject to the security rules applied to
 * uploads.</p>

 * NetConnection, Timer, Sound, or Video objects of the child SWF file. As a
