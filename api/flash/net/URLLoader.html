 * URL-encoded variables. It is useful for downloading text files, XML, or
 * other information to be used in a dynamic, data-driven application.
 <em>
 * <p>A URLLoader object downloads all of the data from a URL before making it
 * available to code in the applications. It sends out notifications about the
 * progress of the download, which you can monitor through the
 * <code>bytesLoaded</code> and <code>bytesTotal</code> properties, as well as
 * through dispatched events.</p>
 </em>
 * <p>When loading very large video files, such as FLV's, out-of-memory errors
 * may occur. </p>
 <em>
 * <p>When you use this class in Flash Player and in AIR application content
 * in security sandboxes other than then application security sandbox,
 * consider the following security model:</p>
 </em>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A SWF file in the local-with-filesystem sandbox may not load data
 * from, or provide data to, a resource that is in the network sandbox. </li>
 *   <li> By default, the calling SWF file and the URL you load must be in
 * exactly the same domain. For example, a SWF file at www.adobe.com can load
 * data only from sources that are also at www.adobe.com. To load data from a
 * different domain, place a URL policy file on the server hosting the
 * data.</li>
 * </ul>

 * Center Topic: &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/devnet<em>security</em>en"

 * @event complete           Dispatched after all the received data is decoded
 *                           and placed in the data property of the URLLoader
 *                           object. The received data may be accessed once
 *                           this event has been dispatched.
 * @event httpResponseStatus Dispatched if a call to the load() method
 *                           attempts to access data over HTTP, and Adobe AIR
 *                           is able to detect and return the status code for
 *                           the request.
 * @event httpStatus         Dispatched if a call to URLLoader.load() attempts
 *                           to access data over HTTP. For content running in
 *                           Flash Player, this event is only dispatched if
 *                           the current Flash Player environment is able to
 *                           detect and return the status code for the
 *                           request.(Some browser environments may not be
 *                           able to provide this information.) Note that the
 *                           <code>httpStatus</code> event(if any) is sent
 *                           before(and in addition to) any
 *                           <code>complete</code> or <code>error</code>
 *                           event.
 * @event ioError            Dispatched if a call to URLLoader.load() results
 *                           in a fatal error that terminates the download.
 * @event open               Dispatched when the download operation commences
 *                           following a call to the
 *                           <code>URLLoader.load()</code> method.
 * @event progress           Dispatched when data is received as the download
 *                           operation progresses.

 *                           <p>Note that with a URLLoader object, it is not
 *                           possible to access the data until it has been
 *                           received completely. So, the progress event only
 *                           serves as a notification of how far the download
 *                           has progressed. To access the data before it's
 *                           entirely downloaded, use a URLStream object. </p>
 * @event securityError      Dispatched if a call to URLLoader.load() attempts

 *                           sandbox. Also dispatched if a call to
 *                           <code>URLLoader.load()</code> attempts to load a
 *                           SWZ file and the certificate is invalid or the
