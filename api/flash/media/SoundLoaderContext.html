 * sound. SoundLoaderContext objects are passed as an argument to the
 * constructor and the <code>load()</code> method of the Sound class.
 <em>
 * <p>When you use this class, consider the following security model: </p>
 </em>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Loading and playing a sound is not allowed if the calling file is in
 * a network sandbox and the sound file to be loaded is local.</li>
 *   <li>By default, loading and playing a sound is not allowed if the calling
 * is local and tries to load and play a remote sound. A user must grant
 * explicit permission to allow this.</li>
 *   <li>Certain operations dealing with sound are restricted. The data in a
 * loaded sound cannot be accessed by a file in a different domain unless you
 * implement a URL policy file. Sound-related APIs that fall under this
 * restriction are the <code>Sound.id3</code> property and the
 * <code>SoundMixer.computeSpectrum()</code>,
 * <code>SoundMixer.bufferTime</code>, and <code>SoundTransform()</code>
 * methods.</li>
 * </ul>
 <em>
 * <p>However, in Adobe AIR, content in the <code>application</code> security
 * sandbox(content installed with the AIR application) are not restricted by
 * these security limitations.</p>

 *
 * <p>Note that you cannot override the value of
 * <code>SoundLoaderContext.bufferTime</code> by setting the global
 * <code>SoundMixer.bufferTime</code> property. The
 * <code>SoundMixer.bufferTime</code> property affects the buffer time for
 * embedded streaming sounds in a SWF file and is independent of dynamically

 * from the loaded sound's server before beginning to load the sound. This
 * property applies to sound that is loaded from outside the calling file's
 * own domain using the <code>Sound.load()</code> method.
 <em>
 * <p>Set this property to <code>true</code> when you load a sound from
 * outside the calling file's own domain and code in the calling file needs
 * low-level access to the sound's data. Examples of low-level access to a
 * sound's data include referencing the <code>Sound.id3</code> property to
 * get an ID3Info object or calling the
 * <code>SoundMixer.computeSpectrum()</code> method to get sound samples from
 * the loaded sound. If you try to access sound data without setting the
 * <code>checkPolicyFile</code> property to <code>true</code> at loading
 * time, you may get a SecurityError exception because the required policy
 * file has not been downloaded.</p>
 </em>
 * <p>If you don't need low-level access to the sound data that you are
 * loading, avoid setting <code>checkPolicyFile</code> to <code>true</code>.
 * Checking for a policy file consumes network bandwidth and might delay the
 * start of your download, so it should only be done when necessary.</p>
 <em>
 * <p>When you call <code>Sound.load()</code> with
 * <code>SoundLoaderContext.checkPolicyFile</code> set to <code>true</code>,
 * Flash Player or AIR must either successfully download a relevant URL
 * policy file or determine that no such policy file exists before it begins
 * downloading the specified sound. Flash Player or AIR performs the
 * following actions, in this order, to verify the existence of a policy
 * file:</p>
 </em>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Flash Player or AIR considers policy files that have already been
 * downloaded.</li>
 *   <li>Flash Player or AIR tries to download any pending policy files
 * specified in calls to <code>Security.loadPolicyFile()</code>.</li>
 *   <li>Flash Player or AIR tries to download a policy file from the default
 * location that corresponds to the sound's URL, which is
 * <code>/crossdomain.xml</code> on the same server as
 * <code>URLRequest.url</code>.(The sound's URL is specified in the
 * <code>url</code> property of the URLRequest object passed to
 * <code>Sound.load()</code> or the Sound() constructor function.)</li>
 * </ul>
 <em>
 * <p>In all cases, Flash Player or AIR requires that an appropriate policy
 * file exist on the sound's server, that it provide access to the sound file
 * at <code>URLRequest.url</code> by virtue of the policy file's location,
 * and that it allow the domain of the calling file to access the sound,
 * through one or more <code><allow-access-from></code> tags. </p>
 </em>
 * <p>If you set <code>checkPolicyFile</code> to <code>true</code>, Flash
 * Player or AIR waits until the policy file is verified before loading the
 * sound. You should wait to perform any low-level operations on the sound
 * data, such as calling <code>Sound.id3</code> or
 * <code>SoundMixer.computeSpectrum()</code>, until <code>progress</code> and
 * <code>complete</code> events are dispatched from the Sound object. </p>
 <em>
 * <p>If you set <code>checkPolicyFile</code> to <code>true</code> but no
 * appropriate policy file is found, you will not receive an error until you
 * perform an operation that requires a policy file, and then Flash Player or
 * AIR throws a <code>SecurityError</code> exception. After you receive a
 * <code>complete</code> event, you can test whether a relevant policy file
 * was found by getting the value of <code>Sound.id3</code> within a
 * <code>try</code> block and seeing if a <code>SecurityError</code> is
 * thrown.</p>
 </em>
 * <p>Be careful with <code>checkPolicyFile</code> if you are downloading
 * sound from a URL that uses server-side HTTP redirects. Flash Player or AIR
 * tries to retrieve policy files that correspond to the <code>url</code>
 * property of the URLRequest object passed to <code>Sound.load()</code>. If
 * the final sound file comes from a different URL because of HTTP redirects,
 * then the initially downloaded policy files might not be applicable to the
 * sound's final URL, which is the URL that matters in security
 * decisions.</p>
 <em>
 * <p>If you find yourself in this situation, here is one possible solution.
 * After you receive a <code>progress</code> or <code>complete</code> event,
 * you can examine the value of the <code>Sound.url</code> property, which
 * contains the sound's final URL. Then call the
 * <code>Security.loadPolicyFile()</code> method with a policy file URL that
 * you calculate based on the sound's final URL. Finally, poll the value of
 * <code>Sound.id3</code> until no exception is thrown.</p>
 </em>
 * <p>This does not apply to content in the AIR application sandbox. Content
 * in the application sandbox always has programatic access to sound content,
 * regardless of its origin.</p>
